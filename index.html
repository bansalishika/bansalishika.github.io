    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:justify">
        <ul>
        <li>In the summer of Grade 11, I decided to learn Python.</li>
        <li>I took online Computer Science MOOCs (massive open online courses) on Udacity.</li>
        <li>As part of the process, I made mini-projects like an economics quiz (<a href="http://bit.ly/economics_quiz">Click</a> here for source code)</li>
        <li>Then, I used my web programming skills (HTML, CSS) and Python, to build ‘Fresh Tomatoes’, a website to watch trailers for various Hollywood and Bollywood movies.(<a href=" http://bit.ly/movie_trailer_ishika">Click </a> here for source code)</li>

    <h2>Sustainable Wall Hanging (Grade 10 Design Project)</h2>
    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:justify">
    <ul>
        <li>In 2016-17, I undertook a design project in which I made a sustainable wall hanging with storage—using an old pair of jeans.</li>
        <li>Product’s main aim is to help people store magazines, cups, keys and other small items in an easy and organised manner.</li>
        <li>I learnt how to unstitch using a seam ripper; how to mark accurate lines on the cloth using appropriate procedure; and using a sewing machine. </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:justify">
    <ul>
        <li>In 2018, I designed and built a serving tray which helps to conveniently serve drinks and snacks. </li>
        <li>The tray is made from leftover pine wood pieces from wood industries which makes it environmental friendly.</li>
        <li>The goal was to decrease the distress caused while serving drinks and make it a culture for people to use sustainable products. </li>

    <h2>Extended Research in Economics</h2>
    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:justify">
        <ul>
        <li><strong>About:</strong> I studied the Patel Chest Market located in Delhi University. This market is a large printer market with around 80 small printer shops. These shops provide similar services at similar prices. But their  consumer base is different.</li>
        <li><strong>Why I did this:</strong> I was studying theories of different market structures—Monopoly, Oligopoly, Perfect Competition, Monopolistic Competition—in my Economics classes. I was curious to understand this in depth. </li>
        <li><strong>Project question:</strong>“Which type of market structure does Patel Chest Market mostly resemble to?” </li>
        <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> For this research project, I collected primary data by desigining a survey experiment in the market to understand both consumers and producers. Later, I backed up my findings using secondary sources</li>

        </ul>

    <h2>The Reverie - Movie Making</h2>
    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:justify">
        
        <ul>
        <li>We made a film on the theme, 'Dream, Desire, Destiny.' </li>
        <li><strong>About the film:</strong> The idea was based on a disabled dancer and a deaf piano man. We showed how destiny played its part by bringing them together because of the medium of arts. 
</li>
        <li>This project gave me an insight as to what all elements go into creating a movie. For instance, lighting, camera angle, make up etc. I got to know how a film is directed and planned. </li>
        <li>The movie won the BEST FEATURE- FILM MAKING INCOGNITO 2017, an inter school competition conducted in Pathways School, Gurgaon. </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Girl Hygine</h2>
    <div class="col-sm-6" style="text-align:justify">

    <ul>
        <li>We made a short film to promote the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ campaign. It talks about usage and disposal of sanitary napkins, and how it could affect women hygiene. </li>
        <li><strong>About the film:</strong> The film suggests that an incinerator could be a good way to dispose of sanitary napkins. This can convince more women to use sanitary napkins. Besides this, planting 10 saplings for every 2 bags filled with sanitary napkins can help balance out the pollution caused by usage of incinerator. 
</li>
        <li><strong>Achievement:</strong> The film won the first position in IILM’s Young Entrepreneur Ideation Challenge 2017 held at IILM University. The competition’s aim was to look for innovative solutions to a social problem.</li>
